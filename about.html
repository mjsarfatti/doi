				<h3>Background on lobbying and conflicts of interest</h3>
				<p>Over recent years, public policy debates have been giving increasing
				attention to the importance of safeguarding the integrity of
				parliamentarians and their activities.&nbsp; As the scope of
				interaction between public and private sectors increases, for example
				through the greater privatisation of public services, the systematic
				use of external expertise to feed into law-making, and individuals
				moving in and out of each sector over the course of their careers,
				ethics regimes in public institutions need to be sufficient to deal
				with heightened integrity and corruption risks.&nbsp; As the OECD
				noted in their <a href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/48994419.pdf">2005
				Guidelines for Managing Conflict of Interest in the Public Service</a>,
				without adequate <em>identification
				and management</em> of potential
				conflicts of interest, the opportunities for public figures to abuse
				their positions for personal gain increase.&nbsp; Protections
				therefore need to be in place to ensure that legislators serve the
				public interest and not narrow, vested interests.</p>
				
				<p >The
				situation in Europe is mixed.&nbsp; In our 2012 report &lsquo;<a href="http://www.transparency.org/enis/report">Money, Politics, Power: Corruption Risks in Europe</a> &rsquo;,
				Transparency International looked at the anti-corruption safeguards
				in 25 European countries.&nbsp; Our research found that while only a
				small number of these countries had codes of conduct in place for
				parliamentarians, the majority do require legislators to declare
				their interests, assets and outside income.&nbsp; However, problems
				were noticed in the verification mechanisms in many countries,
				affecting public confidence in the veracity of declarations.</p>
				
				<p >In its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf">2014 EU Anti-Corruption Report</a>,
				the European Commission identified similar concerns, highlighting the
				lack of checks on financial declarations of national MPs as a major
				weakness in the integrity systems of many EU countries. Verifications
				on the substance of declarations of interests were found often to be
				&lsquo;formalistic and mostly limited to administrative checks&rsquo;,
				with the tools and capacity to carry out substantial checks deemed to
				be &lsquo;insufficient&rsquo;.</p>
				
				<h3>Background on the
				European Parliament&rsquo;s Code of Conduct</h3>
				<p >As a reaction to the
				cash-for-amendments scandal that hit the European Parliament in 2011
				(in which four members accepted payments from undercover journalists
				posing as lobbyists in exchange for the introduction of legislative
				amendments) a new <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/meps/201206_Code_of_conduct_EN.pdf">code
				of conduct</a> was introduced in 2012.</p>
				
				<p >The Code obliges Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to submit information on
				their financial interests, to declare their attendance at third party
				events and to reveal any gifts that they have received.</p>
				
				<p >On paper the 2012
				Code of Conduct meant significant progress and the reporting
				obligations were quite extensive at the time. Unfortunately the
				implementation proved less ambitious. Despite recommendations by the
				Advisory Committee to the President of the European Parliament
				finding that seven MEPs had violated the Code of Conduct, not a
				single one has been sanctioned to date.</p>
				
				<p >National Parliaments
				across Europe &ndash; Germany, France and the United Kingdom in
				particular &ndash; have significantly
				tightened their rules and reporting obligations during the last two
				years.
				Often these steps came in direct responses to scandals. In
				comparison, the European Parliament is now falling behind standards
				at national level, and this in a moment when euro-scepticism and
				public perception of the EU institutions as corrupt are at an
				all-time high.</p>
				
				<p >In this context
				Transparency International has published a comprehensive review of
				the integrity of 10 EU Institutions, including the European
				Parliament, Commission Council and the European Court of Justice
				(<a href="http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/focus_areas/eu-integrity-study/">EUIS
				report</a>). Transparency International is using the
				findings to advocate change inside the institutions and has
				recommended a reform of the Code of Conduct of the European
				Parliament that would establish an independent ethics committee to
				monitor potential conflicts of interest.</p>
				
				<h3>Background on the EU Integrity Watch project </h3>
				<p >Following the
				elections to the European Parliament in May, the new Parliament took
				office on the 1st of July 2014. All members &ndash; new and old &ndash;
				had until the 3rd of July to submit their declarations of financial
				interest, thereby submitting their information on outside revenues,
				board memberships and financial holdings.</p>
				
				<p >Policy recommendations
				</p>
				
				<p >This user-friendly
				database provides a unique overview of the activities of the newly
				elected European Parliament and enables a range of rankings and
				visual comparisons. It also allows to better monitor potential
				conflicts of interest or to identify those MEPs with a high degree of
				external activity.</p>
				
				<p >For that purpose
				Transparency International has developed an &ldquo;External Activity
				Indicator (EAI)&rdquo; (Methodology),
				which scores each MEP based on the number of outside occupations,
				board memberships or other political mandates as well as the
				cumulative income derived from these activities.</p>
				
				<h3 id="recommendations">Transparency International policy recommendations</h3>
				<p >One conclusion
				that can already be drawn from the EU Integrity Watch database is
				that the declarations of financial interest and thus the Code of
				Conduct of the European Parliament need reform. Meaningful monitoring
				of conflicts of interest is impossible when MEPs declare that their
				side-job is &ldquo;consultant&rdquo;, &ldquo;freelancer&rdquo;,
				&ldquo;manager&rdquo; or something that goes under an abbreviation
				such as &ldquo;RvC FMO&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASDCAM&rdquo;. The financial
				thresholds in the declarations need to be revised and should allow
				much more accurate reporting instead of capping the information at
				&ldquo;more than 10,000 EUR&rdquo;. Better guidelines on how to fill
				out the declarations are needed and the European Parliament should
				better monitor the submitted declarations. An independent ethics
				committee should monitor compliance and publish recommendations in
				case of an alleged breach.</p>
				<p >To further
				improve public monitoring of potential conflicts of interest at the
				Parliament and at the Commission, TI-EU suggests the adoption of a
				&lsquo;legislative footprint&rsquo; mechanism &ndash; a record of all
				meetings between lobbyists and lawmakers. 181 MEPs have already
				committed to using this as part of TI-EU&rsquo;s anti-corruption
				<a href="http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/2014/10/european-parliament-elections-2014-the-anti-corruption-pledge/">election
				pledge</a>.</p>
				<p >Finally, TI-EU
				continues to advocate for a mandatory Transparency Register of
				Lobbyists that covers the European Parliament, the Commission and the
				Council, something that Commission President elect Jean-Claude
				Juncker has announced for his term.</p>
				<h3>Core recommendations:</h3>
				<ul>
				  <li><p >Publish more  detailed information in the declarations to allow a meaningful				  monitoring of potential conflicts of interest</p></li>
				  <li><p >Revise the
				  financial thresholds in the declaration to allow more accurate
				  reporting and monitoring of outside revenue</p></li>
				  <li><p >Translate all
				  declarations into all official languages</p></li>
				  <li><p >The European
				  Parliament administration should better check the declarations for
				  plausibility and possible errors &ndash; false declarations should
				  lead to sanctions</p></li>
				  <li><p >The Code of
				  Conduct needs to be fully respected in word and in spirit and
				  violations need to be sanctioned by the EP President</p></li>
				  <li><p >Standardise as
				  much of the information as possible to allow better comparisons and
				  groupings and to connect the information with other databases, such
				  as the Transparency Register</p></li>
				  <li><p >Publish all
				  declarations of interest in a centralised, searchable manner,
				  including historical declarations (.xml/.json files instead of .pdf)</p></li>
				</ul>

					<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
					<p >EU Integrity Watch
					was launched in October 2014 by the Transparency International EU
					Office (TI-EU). The project is co-funded by the Open Society
					Initiative for Europe (OSIFE).</p>
					
					<h3>Where does the data come from&#8204;?</h3>
<p>All data contained in the EU Integrity Watch database comes from the website of the European Parliament. EU Integrity Watch automatically extracts the information from the original declarations that are published in Pdf format on the Parliament's website and uses them to regularly update its own database. The date of the latest update is featured on our website. EU Integrity Watch is not responsible for the data that is provided by the European Parliament. All information contained in the original declaration is under the sole responsibility of the member of the European Parliament that filled out and signed the declaration. Given that the Parliament only provides the data in Pdf format instead of a reliable .xml format our data might not be 100% accurate. Please report any inaccuracies that you might spot to dfreund@transparency.org</p>
					<h4>How do Members of
					the European Parliament declare their financial interests&#8204;?</h4>
					<p >The Code of Conduct
					of the European Parliament establishes that for reasons of
					transparency, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) shall submit
					a declaration of financial interests. Those declarations shall then
					be published on Parliament's website. The declarations are the
					sole responsibility of each individual member. EU Integrity Watch
					merely copies the information contained in the declarations and makes
					it available on its website. This means that the information is
					currently only available in the language in which the member has
					filled out the declaration.</p>
					
					<p >On each profile of a member we link to the profile on the Parliament's own website,
					where the original declaration and all other information can be
					accessed and verified.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h4>Why are all revenues provided as a range&#8204;?</h4>
					<p>According to the Code of Conduct of the European Parliament all outside revenues or
					financial interests shall be placed in one of the following
					categories:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><p >500 -
					  1,000 EUR per month</li>
					  <li><p >1,001 -
					  5,000 EUR per month</li>
					  <li><p >5,001 -
					  10,000 EUR per month</p></li>
					  <li><p >More than
					  10,000 EUR per month</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p >In case of revenues
					of less than 500 EUR per month or 5,000 per year no category needs to
					be indicated.</p>
					
					<br />
					
					<h4>What is the
					External Activity Indicator (EAI)&#8204;?</h4>
					<p >The External
					Activity Indicator was developed by Transparency International to
					provide a quick overview of all activities that fall under the remits
					of the Code of Conduct and the declarations of financial interests.
					In short, the higher the indicator the more activities a member has
					declared and the higher the declared revenues. The website shades
					MEPs according to their EAI - the higher the EAI the darker the
					grey shading.</p>
					
					<p >The External
					Activity Indicator is not an assessment of an MEP's performance
					or a judgement on the declared activities. It does not identify
					actual conflicts of interest. It only serves to quickly and easily
					identify those MEPs that have a higher number of declared activities
					or a higher declared income from outside activities.</p>
					
					<p >Transparency
					International fully supports the European Parliament in its efforts
					towards greater transparency. Therefore we encourage all Members of
					the European Parliament to provide detailed and accurate declarations
					of their activities and financial interests. Only those declarations
					that provide meaningful and detailed information will allow the
					public and civil society to monitor potential conflicts of interests.</p>
					<br />
					<h4>How is the
					External Activity Indicator (EAI) calculated&#8204;?</h4>
					<p >The External
					Activity Indicator is calculated by an algorithm that allocates
					points for each activity declared in a Member's declaration of
					financial interest. If no activities are declared a member has an EAI
					of 0. Points are attributed as follows:
					
					<ul>
					  <li><p >1 point for
					  each activity (2 points if the activity is a "regular
					  remunerated activity")</p></li>
					  <li><p >1 points for
					  each financial holding</p></li>
					  <li><p >1 point for
					  every 500 EUR of minimum monthly outside revenue</p></li>
					  
					  <li><p >10 points if
					  revenue of "more than 10,000 EUR per month" are declared
					  in at least one activity</p></li>
					</ul>
